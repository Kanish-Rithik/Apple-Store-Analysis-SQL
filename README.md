The "Apple Store Analysis" project was a comprehensive exploration of the Apple App Store using SQLite and SQL skills, leveraging datasets sourced from Kaggle. In this project, I amalgamated multiple datasets to extract valuable insights into the world of iOS apps. Here's a brief overview of the key findings and analyses conducted:

1. Unique Apps: First and foremost, I determined the number of unique apps present in both datasets, providing a foundational understanding of the app ecosystem.

2. Data Quality: I diligently checked for missing values in critical fields, ensuring data integrity and reliability in subsequent analyses.

3. Apps per Genre: I categorized apps by genre and calculated the number of apps in each genre, shedding light on the distribution of app types on the Apple Store.

4. App Ratings Overview: To understand the overall app quality, I generated an overview of app ratings, possibly including average, median, and distribution statistics.

5. Paid vs. Free Apps: A critical aspect of the analysis was comparing the ratings of paid apps against free apps. This investigation aimed to uncover whether paying for an app correlated with higher user ratings.

6. Language Support and Ratings: I explored the relationship between the number of supported languages for an app and its user ratings, investigating whether apps with broader language support tended to have higher ratings.

7. Genres with Low Ratings: Identifying genres with consistently lower ratings provided valuable insights for developers and stakeholders looking to improve app quality in specific categories.

8. Description Length and User Ratings: I examined whether there was a correlation between the length of an app's description and its user rating. This analysis delved into the potential impact of description content on user perception and engagement.

In summary, the "Apple Store Analysis" project combined datasets, conducted data quality checks, and performed various analytical tasks to uncover insights about the Apple App Store ecosystem. The findings provided valuable information for app developers, marketers, and stakeholders, allowing them to make informed decisions and optimize their strategies within the competitive world of iOS apps.
